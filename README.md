### SASS (Sass syntax & SCSS syntax)
* => Variables: for reusable values such as colors, font-sizes, spacing, etc;
* => Nesting: to nest selectors inside of one another, allowing us to write less code;
* => Operators: for mathematical operations right inside of CSS;
* => Partials and imports: to write CSS in different files and importing them all into one single file;
* => Mixins: to write reusable pieces of CSS code;
* => Functions: similar to mixins, with the difference that they produce a value that can than be used; 
* => Extends: to make different selectors inherit declarations that are common to all of them;
* => Control directives: for writing complex code using conditionals and loops (not covered in this course).

#### Add saas
* => npm i node-sass --save-dev
